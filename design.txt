Let's think about the steps required to diagnose a web site.  I think these are in order.  Note that this is for diagnosis, not alerting

Local router failure
  wrong local router IP address
  Local router IP address unreachable
  wrong MAC address from ARP cache (Cache not up to date)
  wrong MAC address from ARP request (Somebody on the LAN is sending a bad ARP response)
  Network Detection Protocol failure (I don't know enough about NDP)

site name failure?
  Name servers in cache unreachable
  DNS failure
    Wrong name servers for domain (NS records in registrar)
    Wrong name servers for delegated sub- domain (NS records in my name server)
    Wrong IPv4 address for server (A records)
    Wrong IPv6 address for server (AAAA records)
  gethostbyname wrong result (IPv4) or ipaddress.IPv6Address  (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html)

Routing failure, firewall failure
  remote IP address unpingable ping or ping6 (Not necessarily a failure, but noteworthy)
  tcptracepath goes the wrong way
  tracepath6 goes the wrong way

Remote host port not listening
  tcp port sends RESET packet
  tcp port does *not* send SYN ACK packet

Application no response (3 handshake completes but then nothing)
Application incorrect response (application dependent)
Application health check failure
HTTP application sends 4xx error in response to known good query
HTTP application sends 5xx error in response to known good query
SSL failure
